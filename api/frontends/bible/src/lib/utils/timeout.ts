	 *
	 * We cache the entire bible and strongs defs in indexdb.
	 *     1. Download the content
	 *     2. Insert each verse and strongs def to indexdb (15,000)
	 *
	 * This takes place in the kjvdata.worker.ts so the app is still usable while seeding the db.
	 *
	 * This timeout is necessary on first load of the app. If the indexdb is still seeding, based on time in ms exceeded,
	 * calls are made to the server to retrieve data.
	 *
	 * Not much incentive to decrease the seed time since it only happens once on app load and with new data versions.
	 *
	 *
	 * example: chapter = await this.timeout(bibleDB.getValue('chapters', bibleLocationRef), 1000)
	 *   */
