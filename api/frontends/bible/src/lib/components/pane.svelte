		 * assign the pane vars to an new pane object and remove the pane.id
		 * by setting it to undefined. i suppose we dont need unset pane id but
		 * the idea is that the existing pane becomes a branch pane so we would
		 * assign the pane vars to a new object and unset the pane id var.
		 * eventually, svelte would update and the pane.id, which would be
		 * undefined. The paneId was still correct. I'm thinking
		 * on update this would be the place to reassign the pane.
		 *
		 * So what made this a very difficult bug to detect was when we assign
		 * the pane to $state, its a new object, setting id = undefined did not
		 * automatically trigger a state refresh. Eventually, when the object would
		 * react to the change the pane.id would be undefined causing the code to flow
		 * to the else block and not updating the height and width of the container.
		 *
		 * looking at the split code in +page.svelte it's obvious that we are creating
		 * an new object and the references of the original pane object would not change.
		 *
		 * If paneId was bound with pane.id then when the pane.id was reset to undefined
		 * then every child paneId bound with pane.id would be undefined causing w/e
		 * issue.
		 *
		 * I don't think a paneId ever changes. So we should make it a convention
		 * to use paneId instead of pane.id. There's a few moments when id is unset
		 * and the paneId would be undefined.
		 *
		 * Also the vars except id are objects so those would have the same reference if bound
		 * to a child component.
